# ish Project Manager

## Introduction

ish is a minimal, productivity focused project management application generally designed for SCRUM and Agile software development,
although its uses can vary much more broadily as the SCRUM based are optional and adaptable and it can just be used as general
project and task management application. This is where the name ish is derived from as it is somewhat for every project management
paradigm e.g SCRUMish - it's for SCRUM to some extent.

I deciced to build ish as I personally couldn't find what I was looking with project management applications for use with my personal
projects. All the solutions I could find were either to complex, with two many features that were required to be used and obviously intented
for larger commercial organisations, or they were either too broad where I could make the functionality what I wanted but it felt it bit
hacked together and missing some essential features needed for SCRUM projects.

I wanted to create something that lay in the middle of these two sided, something that was simple and adaptable and still had the essentials
features while not being to complex and verbose for the solo developer.

The target audience for this application is therefore primarily solo developers working on their side projects and small teams who need
the essentials while not being bogged down in the admin and complexity of commercial applications. While this is the intended audience
anyone is able to use the application and adapt it as far as they can for their personal process and workflow - it works just as well
as a personal task manager or for any product development related process.
